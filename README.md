# Breast Cancer Detection Various ML Algoithms
_________________________________________________

Breast Cancer Detection from  dataset. We are predicting the  patients who have the cancer basedd on collected database.                         

Procedure :                                                                                                            
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                                                                          
=> Load dataset from directory and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.                                                             
=> Map class string values to numerical numbers.                                                                                                   
=> Using iloc segregate the independant and dependant values. (iloc - helps to select values belonging to particular row and column).             
=> Split train and test set for validation.                                                                                                
=> We do feature scaling to scale our data to make all features contribute equally to result.                                                                    
=> Training model for preprocessing dataset.                                                                                  
=> Validating various ML algorithm -                                                                                             
                        - Linear Discriminant Analysis                                                                         
                        - Logistic Regression                                                                         
                        - Decision Tree                                                                                                        
                        - K-nearest Neighbor                                                                         
                        - Naive Bayes                                                                         
                        - SVM                                                                                                        
                        - Random Forest                                                                                                                                
=> validate with kflod and cross_validation and plot.                                                                         
=> Training and prediction using algorithm with high accuracy.                                                                         
=> Observe how our model classify our new data.
